### Project 3 - Security Question Evaluator
**Background**

Security question is one of the common techniques implemented by many organisations to assist users in a self-help password recovery process.  It can also be used as an additional layer during authentication.  The concept of security question builds on the assumption that the questions are personal and only the user is likely to know the answer.  In practices, however, the answers to the questions may be easily sought online or deducted.  As an example, in 2008, Sarah Palin, one of the US vice presidential candidates, has her personal email disclosed during the presidential campaign when an attacker successfully recovered her personal email account password by answering the security questions using publicly available information.

 

**Goal**

The goal of this project is to develop an evaluator for security questions and answers.  The evaluator should assess the quality of questions and answers.  The evaluator may also provide a measure of likelihood of an attacker using OSINT to successfully compromise the security questions.  Thereby, the evaluator can help users in choosing quality security questions and answers and/or alert users that their security questions/answers could be compromised due to (new) information found online.
